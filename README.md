# MazeGenerator
I've made a maze generator, that makes use of 5 different generation algorithms. All the 5 different algorithms work on the same code foundation. It's expandable for more grid-based algorithms.

## Features

- [Can change height and width of the grid](link)
- [Depth-first Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
- [Binary Tree algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)
- [Side winder algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/3/maze-generation-sidewinder-algorithm)
- [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)
- A move-able player, to move along the maze
- [Lighting setting for polished look](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.lightweight@6.7/manual/2d-index.html)

## Software Anaylse 
I've used Unity for this game. This could be made with almost every language that has graphical possibilities. The only visual requirements is to draw a grid and color in the walls. So most languages / engines / frameworks could have been used. I have used Unity because of the fact that it's a nice work environment and gives me the possibility to polish the game in a better way than other options would allow me. Unreal Engine would allow me to do the same, but I've more experience with Unity and because of the time limitations on this project I can't afford to learn a comply new working envi

## Learning Goals
- Understanding maze algorithms
- Create a reusable code base
- Implementing maze algorithms
- Making use of Unity's 2D LWRP
