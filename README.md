# MazeGenerator
I've made a maze generator, that makes use of 5 different generation algorithms. All the 5 different algorithms work on the same code foundation. It's expandable for more grid-based algorithms.

## Features

- [Can change height and width of the grid](link)
- [Depth-first Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
- [Binary Tree algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)
- [Side winder algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/3/maze-generation-sidewinder-algorithm)
- [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)
- A move-able player, to move along the maze
- [Lighting setting for polished look](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.lightweight@6.7/manual/2d-index.html)

## Software Anaylse 
I've used Unity for this game. This could be made with almost every language that has graphical possibilities. The game only needs to draw a grid and color in the walls. So most languages / engines / frameworks could have been used. I have used Unity because of the fact that it's a nice work environment and gives me the possibility to polish the game in a better way than other options would allow me.

## Learning Goals
- Understanding maze algorithms
- Create a reusable code base
- Implementing maze algorithms
- Making use of Unity's 2D LWRP
